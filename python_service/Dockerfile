FROM python:3.11-slim-trixie

# Pinned to the Debian release explicitly (trixie) instead of the unqualified "3.11-slim",
# which silently tracks whatever Debian release is current - a future rebuild could otherwise
# jump to a newer Debian release with a different LibreOffice version with no code change on
# our side, shifting conversion behavior (rendering quirks, font substitution, etc. can all
# vary by LO version) without anything here explaining why. "trixie" is what "3.11-slim"
# already resolves to right now (Debian 13, LibreOffice 25.2.3), so this pin doesn't change
# anything about the image today - it just stops it from moving on its own later.

# LibreOffice (word/excel/ppt <-> pdf, office thumbnails) and Ghostscript (compress-pdf,
# pdf thumbnails) - both installed as normal Debian packages since this runs on a regular
# Linux host, not a size-capped serverless function. fonts-* packages keep converted
# documents from silently substituting missing glyphs.
#
# fonts-liberation covers Arial/Times New Roman/Courier New (metric-compatible), but most
# .docx files created in modern Word default to Calibri (body) and Cambria (headings) -
# with neither font installed, LibreOffice's DOCX import silently substitutes a font with
# different character widths, which reflows line breaks/spacing/pagination differently
# than Word itself would lay the same document out. fonts-crosextra-carlito/-caladea are
# Google's metric-compatible substitutes for exactly those two fonts (same glyph widths,
# so text wraps at the same points Word would use), and are the single highest-impact fix
# for docx/pptx -> pdf formatting drift from the source document.

# Word's newest default theme font, "Aptos" (2023, replacing Calibri), has no freely
# redistributable metric-compatible clone the way Carlito/Caladea cover Calibri/Cambria -
# Microsoft's own Aptos font files require a separate license to install on a server (see
# fontconfig-aliases.conf for the full explanation). This aliases "Aptos"/"Aptos Display"
# to the Carlito/Caladea already installed above, so LibreOffice gets a reasonably close,
# consistent substitute instead of fontconfig's own generic (and worse-matching) fallback.
# It also aliases "Segoe UI Emoji" (the font Word tags emoji/symbol characters with, even in
# plain text documents) to fonts-noto-color-emoji above - without it, none of the fonts here
# have those glyphs at all, so emoji/dingbat characters (checkmarks, arrows, etc.) convert to
# empty boxes in the PDF instead of just looking visually different.

# /usr/local/bin/python3 that runs the FastAPI app itself (see `pip install` below, and the
