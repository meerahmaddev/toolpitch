    """Converts a floating image anchored relativeFrom="paragraph"/"line" into an inline one.

    Word positions such an image as an *offset from wherever its anchor paragraph ends up*,
    not an absolute page position. That's fine as long as the anchor paragraph lands in the
    same place it did in Word - but LibreOffice's layout (line-height/paragraph-spacing
    rounding, font-substitution differences, etc.) never reproduces Word's paragraph flow
    exactly, especially many paragraphs into a long document. Two images anchored just a few
    paragraphs apart can end up with their anchor paragraphs much closer together than Word
    laid them out, so the same relative offsets now put both images at nearly the same
    absolute position - overlapping in the PDF even though Word kept them apart.

    Converting to inline removes the offset entirely: the image sits directly in the text
    flow at the point it's inserted, so it moves together with whatever paragraph it's next
    to instead of drifting independently. relativeFrom="page"/"margin" anchors are left alone
    - those are already an absolute position on the page, immune to this failure mode.

    One thing a floating image's independence from run order hides: Word will happily let a
    document's <w:drawing> run come *before* a caption/label run in the XML (e.g. an "Output:"
    caption typed after the picture was already inserted) while still rendering the caption
    above the picture, purely from the anchor's own offset - run order plays no part. An
    inline image has no such independence; it renders exactly in run order. Left alone, that
    caption would render immediately after the now-inline image on the same line, its text
    sitting right on the image's bottom edge instead of above it. So when a converted image's
    run is followed by a same-paragraph run that still has real text, that run gets moved
    after the image - restoring the "label, then image" reading order the offset used to
    fake, instead of introducing this exact same class of glued-together bug.

    Finally, an inline image is also now subject to normal pagination - a page break can land
    mid-image (cutting it in half across two pages) or between a caption paragraph and the
    image paragraph following it (label stranded on one page, image starting the next). Both
    get a keepLines/keepNext hint to tell LibreOffice's pagination to avoid that, the same
    "keep together" mechanism Word itself uses for exactly this."""

# no explicit shading at all, so it inherits this color from the blank template pdf2docx
# builds new documents from) - confirmed empirically: it shows up on unrelated boxes
# (a page-wide header banner, individual label cells, a whole diagram block) within the
# same source PDF, each with a genuinely different real background behind them, which
# only makes sense if this is a constant placeholder rather than ever a real sampled

    """Best-effort recovery for cells pdf2docx left on its placeholder fill (see
    _PDF2DOCX_PLACEHOLDER_FILL) instead of the source PDF's real background - typically
    a colored header/banner/code-block box, which pdf2docx's table-reconstruction only
    detects reliably for some cells and not others even within the same box (observed on
    a real document: one cell in a header correctly got the true dark-navy fill, its
    immediate neighbor got this placeholder instead). The real color can't be recovered
    from the .docx alone once it's already wrong, and reconstructing it by re-deriving
    z-order among the source PDF's *vector* fill shapes is unreliable in general - a
    decorative box is often several overlapping colored rectangles (a card background,
    a banner on top of it, a highlight on top of that), and picking the "right" one back
    out isn't something that generalizes safely across arbitrary PDFs.

    Instead this renders the actual source page - which has already resolved all of that
    layering into one final visual, the same way a human reading the PDF sees it - and
    samples the real pixel color around where that cell's text sits on the page (found
    via text search, since the .docx keeps no page/position link back to the PDF once
    pdf2docx has produced it). Only applied when: the text is found on exactly one page
    (an ambiguous multi-match, e.g. repeated header text, is not guessed at), and the
    sampled region has one clearly dominant color (a noisy/inconclusive sample - e.g. one
    that mostly landed on text glyphs rather than background - is left alone rather than
    risking a wrong color). Runs before _fix_low_contrast_text, which still gets the
